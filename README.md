Post about Google Trends data on social media.

Download the csv and R script in the same folder and run the R script to see the results for your self. 

You can download your own Google Trends Data by following these steps:
1) Go to trends.google.uk (or according to whichever location you are at)
2) Search for terms 1 in the search box. 
3) Play around with the filters like countries and time period. 
4) Press on "+ Compare" option to enter a term 2 for comparison. 
5) Press the download button on the top right corner of the graph to download the data represented in a csv. 

And lo and behold! You have your trends data! 

This is what my Google Incognito Search results in:
